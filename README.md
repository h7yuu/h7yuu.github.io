# Top 10 Most Common Urban Birds in my Community
### By: JB Milan Romualdo

### Did you know that the Philippines host over 530 bird species? 185 of these are endemic and over 60 are threathened to extinction. Some are rarer than the others. Some chose to live on urban areas while others chose to live on forrested terrain. Some are colorful while others prefer not to be seen. On this site I am going to talk about the Top 10 most Common Urban Birds in my community. 

## 10. Black Naped Oriole

### The black-naped oriole is medium-sized and overall golden with a strong pinkish bill and a broad black mask and nape. These birds are a type passerine bird in the oriole family that is found in many parts of Asia. It is medium-sized and overall golden with a strong pinkish bill and a broad black mask and nape. The adult male has the central tail feathers tipped yellow and the lateral ones are more broadly yellow. The female has the mantle colour more greenish or olive. The juvenile has a streaked underside. The nestling has dull greenish with brown streaks.There are several distinctive populations within the wide distribution range of this species and in the past the slender-billed oriole was included as a subspecies. They eat a wide variety of fruit, such as mangoes, bananas, and figs. Insects in their diet include termites, grasshoppers, and cicadas. They also sometimes drink nectar from flowers. In addition, black-naped orioles will sometimes raid the nests of other birds. 

## 9. Philippine Pygmy Woodpecker

### The Philippine pygmy woodpecker also known as the Philippine woodpecker, is a species of bird in the woodpecker family. The woodpecker is endemic to the Philippines. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. It needs a few dead trees, but seems to adapt, at least on some islands, to plantations, villages and other anthropogenic environments. But despite these habitats, most of them prefer to stay on forest. It consumes invertebrates found on or in the trunks, in particular ants. Its hunting strategy is similar to that of other woodpeckers, and it digs a gallery to settle its nest as others do. 

## 8. Philippine Pied Fintail

### The Philippine pied fantail is a species of bird in the family Rhipiduridae. It was formerly considered conspecific with the Malaysian pied fantail. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is common to the Philippines, mostly in the southern parts and raises its tail to attract females. They are mostly black and white in color and normal in shape. It flies together/commonly with Eurasian tree sparrows and chestnut munias. Insects are the main source of food and they are constantly moving while foraging for prey. It feeds near at the ground and it flies to catch flying insects. 

## 7. White-Collared Kingfisher

### The collared kingfisher is a medium-sized kingfisher belonging to the subfamily "the tree kingfishers". It is also known as the white-collared kingfisher, black-masked kingfisher or mangrove kingfisher. It has a wide range extending from the Red Sea across southern Asia to Polynesia. It varies from blue to green above while the underparts can be white or buff. There is a white collar around the neck, giving the bird its name. It has a variety of calls which vary geographically. The most typical call is a loud, harsh and metallic "kee-kee-kee" repeated several times. It is most commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps. It also inhabits farmland, open woodland, grassland and gardens. In some parts of its range, especially on islands, it can be seen further inland, ranging into forest or into mountain areas. Birds often perch conspicuously on wires, rocks or bare branches. Small crabs and shrimps are the favoured food in coastal regions but a wide variety of other animals are eaten including insects like beetles stick-insects, grasshoppers, moths and butterflies, spiders, earthworms, snails, frogs, lizards, small snakes, small fish, and sometimes small birds and mice.



## 6. Olive-Backed Sunbird

### The olive-backed sunbird (Cinnyris jugularis), also known as the yellow-bellied sunbird, is a species of sunbird found from Southern Asia to Australia. They are small songbirds, at most 12 cm long. In most subspecies, the underparts of both male and female are bright yellow, the backs are a dull brown colour. The forehead, throat and upper breast of the adult male is a dark, metallic blue-black. The olive-backed sunbird is common across southern China and Southeast Asia to Australia and the Solomon Islands. Originally from mangrove habitat, the olive-backed sunbird has adapted well to humans, and is now common even in fairly densely populated areas, even forming their nests in human dwellings. The sunbirds are a group of very small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Their flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering, but usually perch to feed most of the time.


## 5. Yellow Vented Bulbul

### The yellow-vented bulbul or eastern yellow-vented bulbul, is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is a resident breeder in southeastern Asia from Indochina to the Philippines. It is found in a wide variety of open habitats but not the deep forest. It is one of the most common birds in cultivated areas. They appear to be nomadic and roam from place to place regularly. The yellow-vented bulbul builds a well-camouflaged but fragile, loose, deep, cup-shaped nest from grass, leaves, roots, vine stems, and twigs. The nest is untidy on the outside, but neatly lined with plant fibers. It may be built in a wide range of places from low bushes to high trees. This is a species adapted to humans and may even nest in gardens. The yellow-vented bulbul lays 2â€“5 eggs from February to June. The yellow-vented bulbul eats berries and small fruits. They also sip nectar, nibble on young shoots, and consume some insects.

## 4. Zebra Dove

### The Zebra Dove also known as the barred ground dove, or barred dove, is a species of bird of the dove family, Columbidae, native to Southeast Asia. They are small birds with a long tail, predominantly brownish-grey in colour with black-and-white barring. The face is blue-grey with bare blue skin around the eyes.  The species is known for its pleasant, soft, staccato cooing calls. It inhabits scrub, farmland, and open country in lowland areas and is commonly seen in parks and gardens. The zebra dove feeds on small grass and weed seeds. They will also eat insects and other small invertebrates. They prefer to forage on bare ground, short grass or on roads. Unlike other doves, they forage alone, or in pairs. Their colouration camouflages them wonderfully when on the ground or roads. In our country this bird is known as bato-bato

## 3. Red Collared Dove

### The red collared dove also known as the red turtle dove, is a small pigeon which is a resident breeding bird in the tropics of Asia. The male has a blue-grey head and a red-brown body. The female is much plainer, with pale brown plumage similar to that of the larger Eurasian collared dove. The red collared dove is a relatively small species, with a length of 20-23 cm and a weight of around 104 g.  The male has a bluish head and light red-brown body with a black ring round its neck, while the female is similar but pinkish all over. It feeds on seeds of grasses and herbs, as well as cultivated seeds, including rice and maize, buds and young leaves. Most if not all food taken from the ground. It usually occurs in twos or threes but may gather in flocks of 50 or more at good food sources.

## 2. Chesnut Munia

### The Chensut Munia is a small passerine. It was formerly considered conspecific with the closely related tricoloured munia, but is now widely recognized as a separate species. The chestnut munia is a small bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open grassland and cultivation. Adults tend to have black head, grey to blue bill and brown body. Its nest is a large domed grass structure in a bush or tall grass into which 4-7 white eggs are laid. This animal is a resident breeding bird in Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and Hawaii. It also has been introduced to all the Greater Antilles and Martinique in the Caribbean. Before 1995, it was the national bird of the Philippines where it is known as "mayang pula" because of its brick red patch on the lower back which is visible only when it flies.  

## 1. Eurasian Tree Sparrow

### The Eurasian Tree Sparrow is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it is known as the tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range. In our country, this birds reside at houses. It is considered as a pest for farmers and an invasive species in the ecosystems it doesn't belong to.
